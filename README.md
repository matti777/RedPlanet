# Red Planet

A small demo application for Apple VisionOS that demostrates geometry generated in code as well as the use of custom shaders.

Developed in the spirit of the old PC demo "mars".

# TerrainMaterial explained

TBA

For a nice Shader Graph primer, see [this WWDC video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202/).

NOTE: there seems to be a weird issue with these materials created in a an USDx file; their textures *will not work* in your app unless you create a dummy object in the USDx file (in Reality Composer Pro) *and* bind your material to it! (Situation Xcode 15.3 Beta)
